1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

A product owner can conduct meetings with users to find out what features are most desired. From there, the product owner can develop the comments from users into user stories. It is the user stories that most effectively allow a team to develop a user's needs into a functional feature byh providing the team with a clear goal to accomplish.

2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

From concept to completion agile offers a process that allows a team to be flexible in their development processes to compensate for an ever changing world. Implementing these stages is the first thing I intend to utilize in my work in development. Other elements I intend to utilize going forward are the Kanban boards and agile estimation practices. The Kanban board is a great way to stay organized and plan tasks while agile estimation is useful for deciding on the time and scale of elements of a project.

3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member you must attend mandatory meetings, contribute to said meetings, collaborate with other members of the team, be willing to admit what you don't know, always be open to the assistance of others, and have a good attitude.
